Analyze the following {language} code and extract structured information for semantic search indexing.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Output ONLY valid JSON matching the provided schema
- No explanatory text, markdown, or additional commentary
- Ensure all JSON is properly formatted and escaped

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

### FILE-LEVEL INFORMATION
- Determine programming language from file extension and syntax
- Write a concise one-paragraph summary of the file's purpose
- List all import/using/include statements with their line numbers

### FOR EACH CODE ELEMENT

Extract the following for each class, function, method, property, field, struct, interface, enum, namespace, constructor, delegate, signal, constant, and other significant elements:

**Identification:**
- Element type (class, method, property, etc.)
- Name
- Access modifier (public, private, protected, etc.)
- Exact line numbers (start and end, 1-indexed)
- Complete signature/declaration

**Documentation:**
- Clear description of what the element does and its purpose
- Extract documentation comments if present

**For Functions/Methods:**
- Parameters: names and types
- Return type (use "void" or "None" for no return)

**For Classes/Structs:**
- Properties/fields: names, types, and accessors (get/set/init)
- Include all properties, fields, methods, and nested types as separate elements

**Relationships:**
- Inheritance (extends, implements)
- Type usage in parameters, returns, or properties
- Method/function calls within the element
- External module dependencies

## SPECIAL CASES

- **Properties**: Include as separate elements with property-type "property"
- **Fields**: Include as separate elements with property-type "field"
- **Constructors**: Include as separate elements with property-type "constructor"
- **Nested types**: Include as separate elements

## QUALITY CHECKS

Before outputting JSON, verify:
1. All required fields are present
2. Line numbers are accurate and 1-indexed
3. Descriptions are informative but concise
4. JSON is valid and properly structured

Format the response as JSON matching this schema:

            "name": "element_name",
            "access-modifier": "public|private|protected|internal|package|default",
            "start-line": number,
            "end-line": number,
            "signature": "full declaration",
            "description": "what it does",
            "parameters": [
                {"name": "param1", "argument-type": "string"}
            ],

            "properties": [
                {"name": "prop1", "value-type": "string", "accessors": ["get", "set"]}
            ],
            "dependencies": [
                {"relationship-type": "inherits", "target": "BaseClass"}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
