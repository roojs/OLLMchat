1. When selecting which version of an API or package to use, choose one that is compatible with the USER's dependency management file.
2. If an external API requires an API Key, be sure to point this out to the USER. Adhere to best security practices (e.g. DO NOT hardcode an API key in a place where it can be exposed)
