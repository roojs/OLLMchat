 The two tables are almost the same, but **pressrelease_notify_archive** is missing a few columns (and a few indexes) that exist in **pressrelease_notify**.  
-
 The quickest way to bring the archive table up‑to‑date is to issue a series of `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` (and `ADD KEY`) statements that match the definition in the main table.
 
 Below is a ready‑to‑run script that adds every column that is present in **pressrelease_notify** but absent in **pressrelease_notify_archive**, and then adds the indexes that are also missing.

 ### What the script does
 
 | Step | What is added | Why it matters |
-| :--- | :--- | :--- |
+|------|---------------|----------------|
 | **Columns** | `field`, `evtype`, `domain_id`, `ipv6_id`, `email_id` | These columns exist in `pressrelease_notify` but are absent from the archive table. |
 | **Indexes** | All keys that are present in the live table but missing from the archive (`is_open_idx`, `lookup_c`, `lookup_h`, `lookup_g`, `lookup_x`, `lookup_j`, `lookup_k`, `ix_match`, `lookup_to_email`, `lookup_reject`, `lookup_em`, `lookup_q`) | Indexes dramatically affect query performance and are part of the “identical schema” requirement. |
 | **Verification** | `SHOW CREATE TABLE` for both tables | Lets you double‑check that the definitions now match. |
 
 ### Optional tweaks
 
-- If you want the archive table **exactly** like the live one (including column order), you can add `AFTER <column>` clauses to place each column where it belongs.
-- If the live table’s columns `field`, `evtype`, and `domain_id` are **nullable** (the `CREATE TABLE` you posted shows them as nullable), you may want to `MODIFY` those columns after adding them to match the nullability:

 ### Running it safely
 
 1. **Backup** the archive table (or the whole DB) first.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE pressrelease_notify_archive_backup LIKE pressrelease_notify_archive;
