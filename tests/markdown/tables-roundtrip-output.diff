 # Tables
 
 | Left | Center | Right |
-| :--- | :---: | ---: |
-| a | b | This is the last column with plenty of text so we can check that the layout gives it more space when columns are not homogeneous. |
-| d | e | Another row in the right column, also with a longer paragraph to ensure the column width adjusts to fit the content. |

 Table with **bold** in a cell:
 
-| Col1 | Col2 |
-| :--- | :--- |
-| *x* | This column has more text so it should take more horizontal space when column_homogeneous is false. We can use `code` and **bold** here too. |
