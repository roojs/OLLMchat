# Tables

| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| a    | b      | This is the last column with plenty of text so we can check that the layout gives it more space when columns are not homogeneous. |
| d    | e      | Another row in the right column, also with a longer paragraph to ensure the column width adjusts to fit the content. |

Table with **bold** in a cell:

| Col1 | Col2   |
|------|--------|
| *x*  | This column has more text so it should take more horizontal space when column_homogeneous is false. We can use `code` and **bold** here too. |
