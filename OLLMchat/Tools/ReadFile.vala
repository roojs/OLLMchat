Read the contents of a file (and the outline).

When using this tool to gather information, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the COMPLETE context. Each time you call this command you should:
1) Assess if contents viewed are sufficient to proceed with the task.
2) Take note of lines not shown.
3) If file contents viewed are insufficient, and you suspect they may be in lines not shown, proactively call the tool again to view those lines.
4) When in doubt, call this tool again to gather more information. Partial file views may miss critical dependencies, imports, or functionality.

If reading a range of lines is not enough, you may choose to read the entire file.
Reading entire files is often wasteful and slow, especially for large files (i.e. more than a few hundred lines). So you should use this option sparingly.
Reading the entire file is not allowed in most cases. You are only allowed to read the entire file if it has been edited or manually attached to the conversation by the user.""";
