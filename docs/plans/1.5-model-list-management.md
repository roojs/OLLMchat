# 1.5. Model List Management

## Overview

Model list in the chat dialogue - how it works with a fixed list of models available from the client but active based on the Chat configuration.

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - To be implemented.

## Implementation Details

### Current Situation
- Client has a fixed list of available models
- Chat configuration determines which models are active/available
- Need to reconcile these two sources

### Features
- Display models from client's available models list
- Filter/activate models based on Chat configuration
- Update model dropdown based on active Chat
- Handle model availability changes when switching chats

### Files to Review/Modify
- `libollmchatgtk/ChatWidget.vala` - Model dropdown
- `libollmchat/Client.vala` - Available models list
- `libollmchat/Call/Chat.vala` - Chat configuration
- Model selection UI components

### Implementation Notes
- Review current model list implementation
- Understand how Chat configuration affects model availability
- Ensure model list updates when switching between chats
- Handle cases where Chat's configured model isn't in client's available list
