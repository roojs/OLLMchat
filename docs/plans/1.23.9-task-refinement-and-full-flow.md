# 1.23.9 Task Refinement and Full Flow — merged into 1.23.11

**This plan has been merged into [Plan 1.23.11 (Runner implementation)](1.23.11-runner-implementation.md).**

Refinement path and full flow (refinement prompt, Skill call parsing, precursor injection, re-run with feedback) are now **Phase 3** in 1.23.11. All Runner implementation and flow live in that single plan.
