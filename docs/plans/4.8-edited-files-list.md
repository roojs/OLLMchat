# 4.8. Edited Files List

## Overview

Add functionality to track and display a list of files that have been edited during the current session. This provides users with a clear view of what files have been modified, making it easier to review changes and manage edits.

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - To be implemented.

## Goals

- Track files that have been edited during the session
- Display edited files list in UI
- Allow users to view/edit the list
- Provide quick access to edited files
- Show file status (saved/unsaved)

## Implementation Details

### File Tracking

- Track files when they are edited via EditMode tool
- Store edited file references with metadata:
  - File path
  - Edit timestamp
  - Save status (saved/unsaved)
  - Number of edits

### UI Components

- Add edited files list widget/panel
- Display file names with status indicators
- Allow clicking to open/edit files
- Show edit count or last edit time
- Provide clear/clear all functionality

### Integration Points

- Integrate with EditMode tool to track edits
- Integrate with FileBuffer to track save status
- Integrate with code editor to show edited files
- May integrate with session/history system

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- `libollmchatgtk/EditedFilesList.vala` - Widget for displaying edited files list
- `libollmchat/EditedFilesManager.vala` - Manager class for tracking edited files (if needed)

### Files to Modify
- `liboctools/EditMode.vala` - Track edits when files are modified
- `libocfiles/FileBuffer.vala` - Track save status
- `ollmapp/Window.vala` - Add edited files list to UI
- `libollmchatgtk/ChatWidget.vala` - Integrate edited files list (if needed)

## Design Considerations

### Storage

- **Option A**: In-memory only (lost on restart)
- **Option B**: Persist to session/history
- **Option C**: Store in project configuration

**Recommendation**: Option B - Persist to session so edited files are remembered across restarts

### Display Location

- **Option A**: Sidebar panel in code editor
- **Option B**: Tab or section in main window
- **Option C**: Dropdown or popover menu

**Recommendation**: Option A - Sidebar panel provides persistent visibility

## Future Enhancements

- Diff view for edited files
- Revert changes functionality
- Export edited files list
- Filter/search edited files
- Group by project or directory
