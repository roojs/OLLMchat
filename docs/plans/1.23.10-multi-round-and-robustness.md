# 1.23.10 Multi-Round and Robustness — merged into 1.23.11

**This plan has been merged into [Plan 1.23.11 (Runner implementation)](1.23.11-runner-implementation.md).**

Multi-round loop (continuation → continue/conclude), error handling, refinement re-run in error path, and user-facing messages are now **Phase 4** in 1.23.11. All Runner implementation and flow live in that single plan.
