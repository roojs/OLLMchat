# 6.0. Other Ideas (Really Low Priority)

## Phase 13: GPU Support Research

- Investigate FAISS packaging
- Research GPU support options

## TODO: FAISS Packaging Investigation

- [ ] Investigate FAISS packaging in Debian/Ubuntu repositories
- [ ] Determine if we can modify the Debian build to include GPU support
- [ ] Research building FAISS from source with GPU support
- [ ] Evaluate alternative packaging approaches (e.g., custom PPA, static builds)
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations for GPU support implementation
