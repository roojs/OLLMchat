# 2.4.1. URGENT - Edit Tool Migrate to Use Project Manager and Buffer

## Overview

Migrate `libollmchat/Tools/RequestEditMode` to use `ProjectManager` and buffer-based file operations instead of direct file I/O. This ensures consistent file handling, proper backup management, and eliminates race conditions when counting file lines after writes.

## Status

🚨 **URGENT** - In Progress

## Problem

The current `libollmchat/Tools/RequestEditMode` implementation:
- Uses direct file I/O (`DataInputStream`/`DataOutputStream`) instead of buffers
- Reads files directly from disk after writing, causing race conditions
- Does not use `ProjectManager` for file access
- Does not benefit from automatic backup management
- Line counting fails due to file system caching/timing issues

The `liboctools/RequestEditMode` already uses the correct approach with buffers and `ProjectManager`.

## Goals

1. Migrate `libollmchat/Tools/RequestEditMode` to use `ProjectManager` and buffers
2. Remove all direct file I/O operations
3. Use `file.buffer.read_async()` for reading
4. Use `file.buffer.write()` for writing (automatic backups)
5. Use `file.buffer.get_line_count()` for line counting (no disk reads)
6. Ensure `EditMode` tool class has `project_manager` property

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add ProjectManager Support to EditMode Tool

- [x] Add `project_manager` property to `libollmchat/Tools/EditMode` class
- [x] Update `EditMode` constructor to accept optional `ProjectManager` parameter
- [x] Ensure `project_manager` is passed from `Window.vala` when creating the tool

### Phase 2: Migrate File Access to Use ProjectManager

- [ ] Update `RequestEditMode.apply_all_changes()` to:
  - Get or create `File` object using `project_manager.get_file_from_active_project()`
  - Create fake file if not in project: `File.new_fake(project_manager, path)`
  - Ensure buffer exists: `file.manager.buffer_provider.create_buffer(file)`
- [ ] Remove direct file existence checks (`GLib.FileUtils.test`)
- [ ] Use `file.buffer.is_loaded` to check if file is loaded

### Phase 3: Migrate File Reading to Buffer

- [ ] For edit mode (non-complete_file):
  - Replace `apply_edits()` streaming approach with buffer-based approach
  - Use `file.buffer.read_async()` to load file if needed
  - Use `file.buffer.get_text()` or `file.buffer.apply_edits()` for applying changes
  - Remove `process_edits()` method that uses `DataInputStream`
- [ ] Remove temporary file creation and file move operations

### Phase 4: Migrate File Writing to Buffer

- [ ] For complete_file mode:
  - Replace `create_new_file_with_changes()` direct file writing
  - Use `file.buffer.write(replacement_content)` instead
  - Remove `DataOutputStream` usage
- [ ] For edit mode:
  - Use `file.buffer.apply_edits(changes)` if available
  - Or use `file.buffer.write(final_content)` after reconstructing in memory
- [ ] Ensure all writes go through buffer (automatic backups for project files)

### Phase 5: Fix Line Counting to Use Buffer

- [ ] Replace `count_file_lines()` disk reading with buffer-based counting
- [ ] For complete_file mode: After writing to buffer, use `file.buffer.get_line_count()`
- [ ] For edit mode: After applying edits, use `file.buffer.get_line_count()`
- [ ] Remove all `DataInputStream` usage for line counting
- [ ] Remove all character-by-character loops for line counting
- [ ] Use buffer's built-in `get_line_count()` method (no manual counting needed)

### Phase 6: Update Permission Handling

- [ ] Check if file is in active project before permission prompts
- [ ] Skip permission checks for files in active project (auto-approved)
- [ ] Only prompt for files outside active project

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test complete_file mode (new file creation)
- [ ] Test complete_file mode (overwrite existing file)
- [ ] Test edit mode (single edit)
- [ ] Test edit mode (multiple edits)
- [ ] Test edit mode (insertions at end of file)
- [ ] Verify line counting is accurate
- [ ] Verify backups are created for project files
- [ ] Verify no race conditions in line counting

## Files to Modify

- `libollmchat/Tools/EditMode.vala` - Add `project_manager` property
- `libollmchat/Tools/RequestEditMode.vala` - Migrate to buffer-based operations
- `ollmchat/Window.vala` - Pass `project_manager` to `EditMode` constructor

## Reference Implementation

See `liboctools/RequestEditMode.vala` for the correct implementation pattern:
- Uses `project_manager.get_file_from_active_project()`
- Uses `file.buffer.read_async()` for reading
- Uses `file.buffer.write()` for writing
- Uses `file.buffer.get_line_count()` for counting
- Handles fake files for files outside project

## Notes

- The `liboctools` version is the reference implementation
- This migration should make `libollmchat` version match `liboctools` approach
- All file operations must go through buffers - no direct I/O
- Buffer operations handle backups automatically for project files
- Buffer operations are async and thread-safe
