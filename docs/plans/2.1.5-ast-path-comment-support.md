# 2.1.5. AST Path Comment Support

## Overview

Add support for including comments when reading and editing code via AST paths. By default, AST path resolution only includes the code element itself (excluding comments). This enhancement allows users to optionally include preceding comments when reading or editing code blocks.

## Status

⏳ **NOT STARTED** - This plan depends on 2.1.2 (AST Path Support for ReadFile) and 2.1.4 (AST Path EditFile Integration) being complete.

## Related Plans

- **2.1.2** - AST Path Support for ReadFile and EditFile (infrastructure and ReadFile integration)
- **2.1.4** - AST Path EditFile Integration (EditMode AST path support)

## Purpose

Enable LLMs to include documentation comments when reading or editing code:
- Read a method with its documentation comments
- Edit a method and preserve its documentation comments
- Include preceding comments that document the code element

## AST Path Resolution Behavior (Confirmed)

- ✅ **Confirmed**: AST path resolution by default does NOT include comments
- Tree-sitter treats comments as separate nodes, not part of code element nodes
- `Tree.lookup_path()` returns line ranges based on `node_get_start_point()` / `node_get_end_point()`
- These boundaries are the actual code element boundaries, excluding preceding comments

## Implementation Details

### 1. Add Comment Detection to Tree.lookup_path()
- Extend `Tree.lookup_path()` to optionally include preceding comments
- Add `include_comments` parameter to `lookup_path()` method
- When `include_comments=true`, find preceding comment nodes before the element
- Use similar logic to `libocvector/Indexing/Tree.find_preceding_comments()`
- Adjust `start_line` to include comment start line if comments found
- Comment detection should:
  - Look backwards through sibling nodes for comment types
  - Check for comment node types: `comment`, `line_comment`, `block_comment`, `doc_comment`, etc.
  - Only include comments that are adjacent (within 2 lines) to the element
  - Stop at first non-comment node or when gap is too large

### 2. Update ReadFile to Support Comments
- Add `include_comments` parameter to `ReadFile/Request.vala`
- Pass `include_comments` flag to `tree.lookup_path()` in `resolve_ast_path()`
- Update `execute_request()` to use resolved line range (which may include comments)
- Update UI messages to indicate when comments are included
- Update parameter description in `ReadFile/Tool.vala` to document the option

### 3. Update EditMode to Support Comments
- Add `include_comments` parameter to `EditMode/Request.vala`
- Support `type:ast-path:Namespace-Class-Method:include-comments` format in code block parser
- Or add separate parameter for comment inclusion
- Resolve AST path with comment inclusion when flag is set
- Use resolved line range (including comments) for FileChange boundaries
- Update UI messages to indicate when comments are included

### 4. Implementation Details
```vala
// In Tree.lookup_path() - add optional parameter
public bool lookup_path(string ast_path, out int start_line, out int end_line, bool include_comments = false)

// When include_comments=true:
// 1. Get the AST node for the path (need to add get_ast_node() method or traverse)
// 2. Find parent node
// 3. Look backwards through siblings for comment nodes
// 4. Adjust start_line to include comment start if found
```

### 5. Comment Detection Logic
- Similar to `libocvector/Indexing/Tree.find_preceding_comments()`
- Check node types: `comment`, `line_comment`, `block_comment`, `doc_comment`, or contains "comment"/"doc"
- Verify comment is adjacent (within 2 lines of element start)
- Include all consecutive comment nodes before the element
- Stop at first non-comment node or when gap exceeds threshold

### 6. Edge Cases
- Handle files with no comments gracefully
- Handle comments that are too far from element (don't include)
- Handle multiple comment blocks (include all consecutive ones)
- Handle inline comments (typically not included, only preceding block/line comments)

## Files to Modify

### Tree Infrastructure
- `libocfiles/Tree.vala` - Add `include_comments` parameter to `lookup_path()` method
- `libocfiles/Tree.vala` - Add comment detection logic (similar to `find_preceding_comments()`)

### ReadFile Tool
- `liboctools/ReadFile/Request.vala` - Add `include_comments` parameter
- `liboctools/ReadFile/Tool.vala` - Document `include_comments` parameter

### EditMode Tool
- `liboctools/EditMode/Request.vala` - Add `include_comments` parameter
- `liboctools/EditMode/Tool.vala` - Document `include_comments` parameter

## Example Usage

### ReadFile with Comments
```
Tool: read_file
Parameters:
  file_path: "libollmchat/Client.vala"
  ast_path: "OLLMchat/Client/chat"
  include_comments: true
```

**Result**: Returns the `chat` method including its preceding documentation comments.

### EditFile with Comments
```
Tool: edit_mode
Code block:
```vala:ast-path:OLLMchat-Client-chat:include-comments
/**
 * Sends a chat message to the server.
 * @param message The message to send
 */
public void chat(string message) {
    // new implementation
}
```
```

**Result**: Replaces the method including its documentation comments.

## Error Handling

**No Comments Found:**
- If `include_comments=true` but no comments found, return element without comments
- Don't treat as error - just return the element as-is

**Comments Too Far:**
- If comments are more than 2 lines away, don't include them
- Return element without comments (same as if no comments found)

**Multiple Comment Blocks:**
- Include all consecutive comment blocks before the element
- Stop at first non-comment node or blank line
