# Plan documents (`docs/plans/`)

## Audience

- **Humans** skim **title, status, scope, acceptance criteria**, and **`## Concrete code proposals`** (or equivalent). Long narrative sections are **rarely read** — do not rely on them for requirements.
- **Implementers** need **verbatim hunks** (**Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** / **Keep**) and file paths.
- **Long prose** is at best **AI/session context**; it is not a substitute for checklist items and code blocks.

## Tone and length

- **Requests + very brief summaries only** (purpose in a short paragraph or bullets).
- Avoid essays, “current behaviour” novels, and duplicated explanations — put the contract in **code blocks** and tables.

## New methods and helpers

- **Do not add new methods** unless the plan or the user **explicitly** asks for them (see **CODING_STANDARDS.md** — new methods).
- **Private helpers are not automatically an improvement** — they are often **bloat**, hide the real flow, and scatter logic. Default to **changing existing methods** and **inlining** at the call site.
- **Readability via extraction is the user’s decision**, not the implementer’s default. Do not introduce helpers “for clarity” unless the user wants that refactor.

## Required shape (match `docs/plans/done/6.6-DONE-*.md` and `6.8-fixing-large-restore.md`)

1. **Title** — `# N.N Title`
2. **`Status:`** — proposed | done | rejected
3. **Pointer** — `.cursor/rules/CODING_STANDARDS.md` **Checklist for all plans** (copy bullets or link to that section)
4. **`## Purpose`** — 1 short paragraph or bullets (what problem, what outcome)
5. **`## Scope`** — table: In scope | Out of scope
6. **`## Acceptance criteria`** — bullets, testable
7. **`## Concrete code proposals`** (or **`## Proposed code changes`**) — **main deliverable**

Optional, keep short:

- **`## Current behaviour`** — bullets only
- **`## Proposed behaviour`** — bullets only

## Code proposals section (mandatory pattern)

Intro line: hunks are **Remove** / **Replace with** from the tree; verify surrounding context before applying.

For **each** file/topic, use a **numbered** `###` heading, then **only** these subheadings above code:

| Subheading | Use |
| ---------- | --- |
| **`#### Remove`** | Verbatim code to delete |
| **`#### Replace with`** | Full replacement |
| **`#### Add`** | New code only (no removal) |
| **`#### Keep`** | Unchanged surrounding code (**`Keep (before)`** / **`Keep (after)`**) so inserts are not floating in a void |

**Example** (outer fence is `~~~` so inner fences parse):

~~~markdown
### 1. `lib/foo/Bar.vala` — frob the widget

#### Remove

```vala
		old_call();
```

#### Replace with

```vala
		new_call();
```
~~~

One **`####` heading immediately above each fenced block.** No code fence without a **`####`** label.

## Done / archive

When implemented: move or copy to **`docs/plans/done/`**, prefix filename with **`DONE`** or **`REJECTED`**, one-line **Status: DONE** and pointer to files changed.
