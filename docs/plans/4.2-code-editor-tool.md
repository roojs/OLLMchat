# 4.2. Code Editor Interface

## Overview

Code editor tool for viewing and approving changes to files. Allows users to review and approve file changes before they are applied.

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - Complex UI enhancement to be implemented.

## Implementation Details

### Features
- View file changes in code editor
- Approve changes to files
- Track approved file versions
- Handle partial file approvals

### Complex Requirements

#### Auto-commit Assumption
- All changes are assumed to be auto-committed
- **Important**: Git committing automatically should NOT be done on main/master branch
- Use work-in-progress branch for automatic commits
- Need to track which version of file has been approved

#### Approval States
1. **Full file approval**: Jumps to the approved state of the file
2. **Partial file approval**: More complicated
   - Need temporary approved copy of the file
   - Diff against temporary approved copy
   - When further changes occur, compare to temporary approved copy rather than committed copy
   - Handle sliding window between approval process

#### Version Tracking
- Track approved file version
- Maintain temporary approved copy for partial approvals
- Diff management between approved and current state

### Files to Create/Modify
- Code editor component with diff view
- Approval UI
- File version tracking system
- Temporary file management for partial approvals

### Implementation Notes
- Design approval workflow
- Handle edge cases in partial approval
- Manage temporary approved file copies
- Diff algorithm for comparing against approved state
- UI for showing changes and approval status
