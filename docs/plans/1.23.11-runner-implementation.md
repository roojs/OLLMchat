# 1.23.11 Runner Implementation (single plan)

## Overview

Sub-plan of 1.23.2: **single plan** for all Runner (orchestrator) work. **Plans 1.23.8, 1.23.9, and 1.23.10 are merged here** — they were Runner/flow content and do not need separate plans. This plan covers: (Phase 2) single-path flow — task creation (initial) → executor per task → continuation; (Phase 3) refinement — when a task has "skill needed", refinement prompt, Skill call parsing, precursor injection; (Phase 4) multi-round loop — continuation decide continue/conclude, error handling, re-run with feedback, user-facing messages. Plus parsing (1.23.3–1.23.5 formats), link resolution, precursor injection, executor invocation per 1.23.6. All Runner implementation and flow live in this plan only.

## Status

**PLAN** — Implementation not started. Expand this document with all Runner behaviour (phases 2–4, parsing, link resolution, precursor injection, orchestration) so that prompt plans (1.23.3–1.23.6) only define prompts and formats, and this plan is the single source of Runner changes.

## Dependencies

- Plan 1.23.2 (Three Prompt Types and Orchestration).
- Plans 1.23.3, 1.23.4, 1.23.5, 1.23.6: prompt content and **output formats** the Runner must parse and honour.
- Plan 1.23.7: skill-prompts location, skill catalog shape, executor skills layout.
- Plan 1.23.1 (Skill Runner in occoder): existing Runner, Manager, Definition.

## Scope

All Runner (orchestrator) behaviour belongs in this plan. Former plans 1.23.8, 1.23.9, 1.23.10 are merged here (see Phases 2–4 below).

1. **Task creation (initial) — load prompt and parse output (1.23.3):** Load task creation (initial) prompt from `skill-prompts`. **Prompt template:** system and user sections are split by `---`; the prompt body in 1.23.3 must not use `---` internally (see 1.23.3 Concrete prompt, template note). **Build user message** by replacing placeholders in order: `{environment}`, `{project_description}`, `{current_file}`, `{open_files}`, `{previous_proposal}`, `{previous_proposal_issues}`, `{user_prompt}`. When re-running after a problem with the plan, fill `{previous_proposal}` and `{previous_proposal_issues}`; otherwise omit or leave empty. Definitions in 1.23.3 §1 (Precursor information). **Build system message:** prompt body + `{skill_catalog}` replaced by catalog from executor skills’ frontmatter. One LLM call. **Parse output (1.23.3 §2 and Concrete prompt):** original prompt, goals/summary, general information for all tasks, **Tasks** split into **task sections** (Task section 1, Task section 2, …). Sections run sequentially; tasks within a section may run in parallel. Per task: What is needed, Skill, References (markdown links only — series of links), Expected output. **Link resolution:** file links use **absolute path** (1.23.3); resolve to file contents; project summary and plan section targets per 1.23.3. Inject resolved content into precursor area for downstream steps. Required sections and fields; what to do if format is wrong.
2. **Precursor injection:** When a task (or refinement/executor) references precursor by link, Runner injects the corresponding content (current file body, project description, prior task output, plan section) into the markdown precursor area for that step. How links are resolved (target → content); special targets (e.g. `project_description`, `current_file`, task output ids).
3. **Refinement path (1.23.4):** When a coarse task has "skill needed", load task refinement prompt, build input (coarse task + precursor data for skill + precursor contents for any links the task references). Parse refinement output (detailed tasks, Skill call blocks). Skill call parsing: extract skill name + parameters, invoke pre-execution skill, append result to reference_files.
4. **Executor invocation (1.23.6):** For each task ready for execution: build (query, reference_files) including precursor contents for any links; load executor skill from `resources/skills`; one LLM call; parse single-file output.
5. **Task creation (continuation) (1.23.5):** After executor run, load continuation prompt, inject completed task list + executor outputs. Parse decision (continue vs conclude) and optional new coarse tasks. If continue, feed new tasks back into the flow.
6. **Orchestration logic and mode:** Entry point; how Runner chooses mode (initial creation vs per-task refinement/execution vs continuation). Session/state; loop structure. Implement Phases 2–4 below.
7. **Error handling and re-run:** Parse failures (task list, refinement output); missing skill; executor failure. Re-run refinement with feedback when applicable. User-facing messages. (See Phase 4.)

## 1. Task creation (initial) parsing (to expand)

- **Source of truth:** Full output format, user message template, and reference link types are in **Plan 1.23.3** (§2 Output format, §1 Precursor information, Concrete prompt).
- Required sections: original prompt, goals/summary, general information for all tasks, **Tasks** composed of **task sections** (Task section 1, Task section 2, …). Sections run sequentially; within a section, tasks may run in parallel. Parser must preserve section boundaries for orchestration.
- Per-task fields: What is needed, Skill, References (markdown links only — series of links), Expected output. Parse links `[Title](target)`; file targets are **absolute paths** (1.23.3); title is typically file base name. Resolve targets to content for later injection. Validation: required fields present; link targets recognised (absolute file path, `project_description`, plan section/task output).

## 2. Link resolution and precursor injection (to expand)

- Map link target to content: file path → file contents; `project_description` → project description; plan section or task output id → corresponding content. When building input for refinement or executor, inject resolved content into markdown precursor area. Initial precursor (for creation prompt) built from environment, project description, current file contents, user's prompt — see 1.23.3. When re-running after a problem with the plan, also inject previous_proposal and previous_proposal_issues.

## 3. Refinement and Skill call parsing (to expand)

- Load refinement prompt; build input (coarse task + skill precursor data + precursor contents for links). Parse refinement output per 1.23.4; extract Skill call blocks; map skill name to pre-execution skill; invoke with parameters; append result to reference_files. Re-run refinement with feedback on parse/execution failure.

## 4. Executor and continuation (to expand)

- Executor: (query, reference_files with precursor contents) → load executor skill → one file output. Continuation: completed list + outputs → continuation prompt → parse continue/conclude and optional new tasks.

## 5. Orchestration loop and registration (to expand)

- Where Runner is invoked (e.g. from app/agent); how it loads prompt vs skill; skill catalog assembly; directory layout for `skill-prompts` vs `resources/skills`. Integration with 1.23.1 Runner/Manager.

## 6. Phases (merged from former 1.23.8, 1.23.9, 1.23.10)

- **Phase 2 — Single-path:** Creation (initial) → for each task run pre-execution skill (stub if needed) then executor → continuation with results. No refinement yet (tasks with "skill needed" use stub params). End-to-end markdown I/O.
- **Phase 3 — Refinement:** When coarse task has "skill needed", load refinement prompt, build input (coarse task + precursor data + precursor contents for links). Parse Skill call blocks; invoke pre-execution skill; run executor. Multiple coarse tasks (some refined, some direct). Re-run refinement with feedback on parse/execution failure.
- **Phase 4 — Multi-round and robustness:** Continuation returns continue (new coarse tasks) or conclude. Loop: new round = refinement → executors → continuation. Error handling: missing skill, unparseable refinement/continuation output, executor failure; refinement re-run with feedback; user-facing messages. Max rounds/retries. More pre-execution and executor skills as needed.

## Deliverable

- **Single plan** containing all Runner implementation and flow (Phases 2–4): parsing (1.23.3, 1.23.4, 1.23.5 formats), link resolution, precursor injection, refinement, execution, continuation, error/re-run, multi-round loop. Former plans 1.23.8, 1.23.9, 1.23.10 merged here; see redirect stubs in those files.
