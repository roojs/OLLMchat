# 2.20.6. Integration & Testing

## Status

⏳ **PENDING**

## Purpose

End-to-end testing, optimization, and integration of all phases (2.20.1 through 2.20.5). Ensure all components work together correctly and perform well.

## Testing Requirements

### 1. MD5 Incremental Analysis (Phase 2.20.1)

- Test file modification scenarios (single element changed, multiple elements changed)
- Verify unchanged elements reuse cached descriptions
- Verify changed elements get re-analyzed
- Test line number updates for moved code
- Verify FAISS vector updates work correctly
- Test legacy data migration (existing data without MD5)

### 2. Documentation Files (Phase 2.20.2)

- Test various documentation file types (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/*.md)
- Verify documentation appears in search results
- Test file-level summaries for documentation
- Verify markdown files are being indexed correctly

### 3. Image Analysis (Phase 2.20.3)

- Test various image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- Verify image descriptions are generated correctly
- Test image searchability via descriptions
- Test vision model integration
- Verify image metadata is stored correctly

### 4. Folder Summaries (Phase 2.20.4)

- Test folder description generation for various folder structures
- Verify folder metadata is stored correctly
- Test querying folder descriptions
- Test bottom-up processing order (child folders before parents)
- Verify child folders are included in parent folder analysis

### 5. Project Summaries (Phase 2.20.5)

- Test project description generation
- Verify all project information is included (languages, build system, etc.)
- Test coding standards detection
- Verify project metadata is stored correctly
- Test with various project structures

### 6. End-to-End

- Test complete indexing flow: files → folders → project
- Test incremental updates with MD5 caching
- Test search results include all metadata types (files, images, folders, project)
- Performance testing (indexing speed, search speed)
- Test with large codebases
- Test error handling and edge cases

## Deliverables

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for all phases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Bug fixes and optimizations
- [ ] User documentation
