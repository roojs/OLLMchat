# 1.2.7.15. Rename Agent-Related Code from Prompt/* to Agent/*

## Overview

Agent-related classes (AgentHandler, BaseAgent, CodeAssistant, JustAsk, etc.) are currently in the `OLLMchat.Prompt` namespace, but they're really about agents, not prompts.

**Parent Plan**: [1.2.7. Move Remaining Signals from Client to Chat](./1.2.7-move-signals-to-chat.md)

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - Cleanup phase after signal migration.

## Goal

Move agent-related code to a more appropriate namespace that reflects their purpose.

## Issue

Agent-related classes (AgentHandler, BaseAgent, CodeAssistant, JustAsk, etc.) are currently in the `OLLMchat.Prompt` namespace, but they're really about agents, not prompts.

## Current State

- `libollmchat/Prompt/AgentHandler.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.AgentHandler`
- `libollmchat/Prompt/BaseAgent.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.BaseAgent`
- `libollmchat/Prompt/CodeAssistant.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.CodeAssistant`
- `libollmchat/Prompt/JustAsk.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.JustAsk`
- `libollmchat/Prompt/AgentInterface.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.AgentInterface`
- `libollmchat/Prompt/CodeAssistantDummy.vala` → `OLLMchat.Prompt.CodeAssistantDummy`

## Proposed Change

- Move agent-related files from `libollmchat/Prompt/` to `libollmchat/Agent/`
- Change namespace from `OLLMchat.Prompt` to `OLLMchat.Agent`
- Update all imports and references throughout the codebase
- Keep prompt-related code (if any) in `Prompt/` namespace

## Action

Rename namespace and move files during 1.2.7 cleanup.

## Files to Modify

- Move all agent-related files from `libollmchat/Prompt/` to `libollmchat/Agent/`
- Update all imports and references throughout the codebase

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Agent-related code moved to `Agent/` namespace
- [ ] All imports and references updated after namespace change
- [ ] All functionality still works correctly after cleanup
