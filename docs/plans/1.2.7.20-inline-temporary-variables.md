# 1.2.7.20. Inline Temporary Variables in add_message() Calls

## Overview

Many locations in the code create a temporary variable just to pass to `add_message()`, and the variable is never used afterward. These should be inlined directly into the `add_message()` call.

**Parent Plan**: [1.2.7. Move Remaining Signals from Client to Chat](./1.2.7-move-signals-to-chat.md)

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - Cleanup phase after signal migration.

## Goal

Improve code readability by inlining temporary variables used only for `add_message()` calls.

## Issue

Many locations in the code create a temporary variable just to pass to `add_message()`, and the variable is never used afterward. These should be inlined directly into the `add_message()` call.

## Action

- Search for all `add_message()` calls in the codebase
- Identify cases where a temporary variable is created just to pass to `add_message()` and never used again
- Inline the variable creation directly into the `add_message()` call
- This improves code readability and reduces unnecessary variable declarations

## Files to Modify

- All files containing `add_message()` calls with temporary variables (to be identified during cleanup)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Temporary variables in `add_message()` calls have been inlined
- [ ] Code readability improved
- [ ] All functionality still works correctly after cleanup
