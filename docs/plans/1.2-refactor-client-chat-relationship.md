# 1.2. Refactor Client and Chat Relationship

## Overview

Refactor the Client and Chat relationship to make Chat Options a real object rather than a realized one, and ensure that creating new chats copies options from the Client. Use Client values as defaults when creating Chat.

## Status

⏳ **TODO** - Refactoring needed.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes
1. **Make Chat Options a real object** - Currently Chat Options is a "realized" object, should be a proper object
2. **Copy options from Client when creating Chat** - New chats should copy options from the Client
3. **Use Client values as defaults** - When creating Chat, use Client's values as defaults

### Benefits
- Better separation of concerns
- More consistent option handling
- Easier to manage chat configuration
- Clearer relationship between Client and Chat

### Files to Modify
- `libollmchat/Client.vala` - Chat creation logic
- `libollmchat/Call/Chat.vala` - Options handling
- Any files that create Chat instances

### Implementation Notes
- Review current Chat creation flow
- Identify where options are currently "realized"
- Create proper Options object/class
- Update Chat constructor to accept and copy Client options
- Ensure all Chat creation points use Client defaults
