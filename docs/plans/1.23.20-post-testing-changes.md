# 1.23.20 Post-testing changes

**Parent:** 1.23.18 / 1.23. **Source:** Deferred from 1.23.18-tail-end-issues; implement after testing, not in the tail plan.

**Coding standards:** `.cursor/rules/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

## 1. Reference validation and length (deferred from 1.23.18)

- **http(s) validation:** Validate or sanity-check `http://` / `https://` reference targets (e.g. reachable, or format-only). Placeholder is in Details.validate_references(); implement here.
- **validate_task_list_reference_lengths:** Runner method: per-task resolved reference content length (same as Details); if any over max, return issues string. send_async would append to parser.issues and retry.

---

## 2. #ast on files (path#anchor)

- We support **#ast references on files** (path#anchor for code/markdown sections, e.g. method or class in a file).
- **Here:** Implement or extend resolution and **validation** for path#anchor refs (file exists + anchor/section exists in that document). Validation currently only covers bare `#anchor` and absolute path in 1.23.18; path#anchor belongs in this plan.

## 3. Other post-testing items

- Add further items as discovered during or after testing.
