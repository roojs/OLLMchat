# 2.6.1.6. File Scanner Updates and is_deleted Flag

## Overview

Add `is_deleted` flag to FileBase and update file scanner to keep deleted files in database until their backups are deleted.

## Status

⏳ **PLANNING** - Design phase.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 5 (2.6.1.5) must be completed
- See main plan: `2.6.1-code-exec-improvements.md` for file scanner details

## Goals

1. Add `is_deleted` boolean flag to FileBase class and database schema
2. Modify file scanner to check for backups before removing File records
3. Keep deleted files in database until backup is deleted

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- `libocfiles/FileBase.vala` - Add `is_deleted` boolean property and database column
- `libocfiles/Folder.vala` - Modify `read_dir_remove()` to check for backups
- `libocfiles/ProjectFiles.vala` - Modify `update_from()` to check for backups

### is_deleted Flag

- Add `is_deleted` boolean property to `FileBase` class (default: false)
- Add `is_deleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column to `filebase` table in `FileBase.initDB()`
- Add migration to add column to existing databases
- Update `FileBase.copyTo()` to copy `is_deleted` flag

### File Scanner Updates

- **Folder.read_dir_remove()**:
  - Before removing: Check if `file.is_deleted == true` OR if `file.last_approved_copy_path` exists and file exists at that path
  - Only remove File record if `is_deleted == false` AND both original file AND backup don't exist
  - Keep File record if `is_deleted == true` OR if backup exists (allows restoration)

- **ProjectFiles.update_from()**:
  - Before removing: Check if `project_file.file.is_deleted == true` OR if `project_file.file.last_approved_copy_path` exists and file exists at that path
  - Only remove ProjectFile if `is_deleted == false` AND both original file AND backup don't exist
  - Keep ProjectFile if `is_deleted == true` OR if backup exists (allows restoration)

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Add `is_deleted` flag to `FileBase`:
  - [ ] Add `is_deleted` boolean property to `FileBase` class (default: false)
  - [ ] Add `is_deleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column to `filebase` table in `FileBase.initDB()`
  - [ ] Add migration to add column to existing databases
  - [ ] Update `FileBase.copyTo()` to copy `is_deleted` flag
- [ ] Modify `Folder.read_dir_remove()` to check if backup exists or `is_deleted` flag before removing File record
- [ ] Modify `ProjectFiles.update_from()` to check if backup exists or `is_deleted` flag before removing ProjectFile
- [ ] Test file scanner behavior with deleted files that have backups
- [ ] Test file scanner behavior with deleted files that don't have backups
- [ ] Test file scanner behavior with `is_deleted` flag set

## Testing

- Test file scanner with deleted files that have backups (should keep File record)
- Test file scanner with deleted files that don't have backups (should remove File record)
- Test file scanner with `is_deleted` flag set (should keep File record)
- Test database migration for `is_deleted` column

## Notes

- Deleted files are kept in database until backup is deleted
- This allows restoration of deleted files from backups
- File scanner only removes File records when both file and backup don't exist
