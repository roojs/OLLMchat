# 1.23.8 Single-Path Execution — merged into 1.23.11

**This plan has been merged into [Plan 1.23.11 (Runner implementation)](1.23.11-runner-implementation.md).**

Single-path flow (creation → executor per task → continuation) is now **Phase 2** in 1.23.11. All Runner implementation and flow live in that single plan.
