# 1.23.5 Task Creation (Continuation) Prompt

## Overview

Sub-plan of 1.23.2: **create the prompt** for **task creation (continuation)**. The job is to write the actual prompt we use when the model interprets the completed task list and executor outputs and decides whether to **continue** (emit new coarse tasks) or **conclude**. That means defining **what we tell the model** (its role, what it’s going to do), **what we give it** (completed task list + executor outputs), and **what we ask it to produce** (a decision and, if continue, new coarse tasks in the same format as 1.23.3). This plan covers both the prompt content and the output format — they go together.

## Status

**PLAN** — Implementation not started. Expand this document with the full prompt text, placeholders, and output format before implementation.

## Dependencies

- Plan 1.23.2 (Three Prompt Types and Orchestration).
- Plan 1.23.3 (Task creation initial prompt): new coarse tasks (when continue) use the same format.

## Scope

- **Creating the prompt:** Write the prompt file for task creation (continuation). The prompt must tell the model what it is doing (interpreting what was done and deciding the next step), what it has (the completed task list and the files produced by executors), and what it must produce: a **decision** (continue or conclude) and, if continue, a **new coarse task list** in the same format as the initial planner. Optionally a short summary for the user. The output format must be unambiguous so the Runner can parse the decision and, when continue, the new tasks.

## 1. Prompt content (to expand)

- **Role and task:** What we tell the model (e.g. you are the task iterator; you look at what was completed and decide whether to add more tasks or conclude). What it’s going to create (a decision and optionally new tasks).
- **Input:** Completed task list + executor outputs (one file per task or summary). Placeholders: e.g. `{completed_task_list}`, `{executor_outputs}`.
- **Instructions:** Interpret the results; decide continue (if there is more to do) or conclude (if we’re done). If continue, output new coarse tasks in the same format as the initial plan.

## 2. Output format we tell the model to produce (to expand)

- **Decision** — How we ask the model to express “continue” vs “conclude” (e.g. **Decision:** continue, or a dedicated heading). Must be unambiguous for the Runner.
- **Summary** — Optional. Short narrative for the user.
- **New tasks** — Only when decision is continue. Same structure as 1.23.3 (Result summary? + Tasks with Query, Skill needed, Reference, Output).
- **When conclude** — No new tasks. Minimal valid output (Decision + optional Summary).

## 3. Parsing and validation (to expand)

- How the Runner extracts the decision and, if continue, the task list. What to do if decision is missing or malformed.

## 4. Examples (to expand)

- Example in the prompt: conclude + one-line summary. Example: continue + two new coarse tasks.

## Deliverable

- The **prompt** for task creation (continuation): full text, placeholders, and output format. File in `resources/skill-prompts`. Runner uses this prompt and parses output per the format defined here.
