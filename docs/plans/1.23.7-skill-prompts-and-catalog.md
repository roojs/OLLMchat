# 1.23.7 Skill-Prompts and Catalog

## Overview

Sub-plan of 1.23.2: define where prompt files live, the **skill catalog** shape and injection, and the **executor skills** layout in **`resources/skills`**. The **prompts themselves** (what we tell the model and what it produces) are created in 1.23.3–1.23.6; this plan covers the **catalog** (what we inject into the initial prompt), **folder/convention** for prompt files, and **executor skill layout** (frontmatter, precursor data). No Runner orchestration code here.

## Status

**PLAN** — Implementation not started. Expand this document with catalog format and executor layout before implementation.

## Dependencies

- Plan 1.23.2 (Three Prompt Types and Orchestration).
- Plans 1.23.3–1.23.6 (task creation initial, refinement, continuation, execution prompts): prompt content and output format are defined there.

## Scope

1. **Where prompt files live:** e.g. `resources/skill-prompts`. File names and convention (task_creation_initial.md, task_creation_continue.md, task_refinement.md). Prompt **content** is defined in 1.23.3–1.23.6; here we only confirm location and naming.
2. **Skill catalog:** Source (executor skills’ frontmatter), format when injected into the initial prompt (e.g. markdown list), and how to tag skills as research/planning vs execution for ordering guidance.
3. **Executor skills** in `resources/skills`: layout, frontmatter (name, description), how precursor data for refinement is derived. List initial executor skills to support.

## 1. Prompt file location and naming (to expand)

- Directory: `resources/skill-prompts`. Names: e.g. `task_creation_initial.md`, `task_creation_continue.md`, `task_refinement.md`. Content and placeholders are defined in 1.23.3, 1.23.5, 1.23.4 respectively.

## 2. Skill catalog (to expand)

- Assembled from executor skills in `resources/skills` (frontmatter: name, description). Who assembles it (Runner at runtime, or build step). Format injected into initial prompt (markdown list with names and descriptions). Which skills are “research/planning” vs “execution” (tag in frontmatter? naming convention?) for ordering guidance.

## 5. Executor skills layout (to expand)

- Only executor skills in `resources/skills`; each has name, description, body. How precursor data for refinement is derived (e.g. from same file — a “Requirements” or “Parameters” section — or separate spec). List initial executor skills (e.g. codebase_research, plan_create, user_ask) and their role.

## Deliverable

- Documented prompt file location and naming; catalog format and executor skill layout. Prompt content is created in 1.23.3–1.23.6. Runner unchanged in this sub-plan.
