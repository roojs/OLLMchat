# CODER-4.2.5 Project and file selector

**Status:** ⏳ proposed. ✔️ The smoke row hosts project and file selector classes. ⏳ The pop-down alignment, file tabs, and pull-over styling are in those classes and still need a look on screen. Product chrome is still backlog.

**Pointer:** `docs/guide-to-writing-plans.md` — **Checklist for plans**.

**Related:**

- ℹ️ [`CODER-4.2.1-tree-navigation-filedropdown.md`](CODER-4.2.1-tree-navigation-filedropdown.md) — tree tab inside the file picker. The popup chrome in that plan is replaced by this one.
- ℹ️ Phone source-view selection trouble, partly worked: [`docs/bugs/2026-09-29-android-source-view-phone.md`](../bugs/2026-09-29-android-source-view-phone.md).
- ℹ️ Today: `liboccoder/ProjectDropdown.vala`, `liboccoder/FileDropdown.vala`, `liboccoder/SearchableDropdown.vala`, header in `liboccoder/SourceView.vala`.
- ℹ️ Phone history today: `ollmapp/android/OllmchatWindow.vala` swaps `view_stack` to `HistoryBrowser` and keeps the window header. Search is at the top and takes focus (`libollmchatgtk/HistoryBrowser.vala`).
- ℹ️ Diff smoke app: `examples/oc-test-source-diff.vala` (`TestAppBase`). Desktop executable only. It already constructs `OLLMfiles.ProjectManager` and fills the view from local file pairs.
- ℹ️ Header history button is `Approvals` in `liboccoder/SourceView.vala`. The view toggle that replaces it is [`CODER-4.2.4-source-view-markdown-preview.md`](CODER-4.2.4-source-view-markdown-preview.md).

---

## Run

From the repo root. The window loads projects from filesd. No file-pair arguments.

```
ninja -C build examples/oc-test-source-diff
./build/examples/oc-test-source-diff --selectors
./build/examples/oc-test-source-diff --phone
./build/examples/oc-test-source-diff --tablet
```

- ℹ️ `--selectors` is the desktop pop-down.
- ℹ️ `--phone` and `--tablet` are the pull-over. Each one turns the selector subtest on.
- ℹ️ With no file pairs, the window is that row over a source view. The source view's own header stays hidden. Choosing a file opens it there.
- 🚫 Do not pass `--phone` and `--tablet` together.

---

## Purpose

- 🔷 Replace the project selector and the file selector.
- 🔷 They stop being a text entry plus a pull-down.
- 🔷 Resting state on every layout is a flattened button: the current name as text, search icon on the left.
- 🔷 Desktop stays a pop-down. Phone and tablet share a pull-over. Tablet follows the phone, not the desktop.
- 🔷 Phone and tablet also move chat history onto that same pull-over.
- 🔷 Phase 1 proves that row on the existing diff smoke app, on desktop and on Android, with data from filesd.
- ⏳ All work below is backlog.

---

## Shared button

- 🔷 ⏳ Project control and file control are buttons, not entries, until activated.
- 🔷 ⏳ Flattened button. Search icon sits to the left of the label.
- ℹ️ Desktop and touch use the same resting button. What a click does is what splits.

### File button label

- 🔷 ⏳ Phone shows the file name only.
- 🔷 ⏳ Tablet and desktop show the path relative to the project.
- 🔷 ⏳ That relative path ellipsizes at the start, so the end of the path stays visible.
- 🔷 ⏳ Mouse over on tablet and desktop shows the full path.
- 🔷 ⏳ That full-path hover is on the project button and the file button.

### Row

- 🔷 ⏳ No project: the project button says `Select project`.
- 🔷 ⏳ No project: the file button is not shown.
- ℹ️ `SourceView` already hides `file_dropdown` until a project is selected.
- 🔷 ⏳ After a project is selected, the file button is shown.
- 🔷 ⏳ On the phone, the project button has a maximum width.
- 🔷 ⏳ That cap is wide enough for a typical project name.
- 🔷 ⏳ A shorter project name makes the project button narrower than the cap.
- 🔷 ⏳ The file button takes the remaining width of the row.
- 🔷 ⏳ The header history button stays for this pass.
- 🔷 ⏳ That history button is replaced later by the view toggle.
- 🚫 Do not remove the history button in this plan.

## Desktop

- 🔷 ⏳ Click the button and it becomes a text entry and takes focus.
- 🔷 ⏳ That entry is a search, not the old fake pull-down.
- 🔷 ⏳ Search opens a pop-down under the control.
- 🔷 ⏳ Project pop-down is a list of projects.
- 🔷 ⏳ File pop-down is wide.
- 🔷 ⏳ File pop-down tabs:
  - Tree
  - History
  - Search results, when the entry has typed text
- ℹ️ **File list** below is the open rename of History to Recent, and filtering both lists while typing.
- 🔷 ⏳ Choosing a project still moves focus to the file control, as it does now.
  - ℹ️ `SourceView` calls `file_dropdown.grab_focus()` after a project is chosen.
  - 🔷 On desktop that focus is the file control in its entry state, so the file pop-down opens.
- ℹ️ Tree-tab contents stay specified in `CODER-4.2.1`. This plan only places that tab in the wide file pop-down.

---

## Project list

`ProjectSelector` lists projects. Recent / All is on that pop-down and on the project pull-over.

- 🔷 ✔️ A Recent / All bar on the project pop-down and on the project pull-over.
- ℹ️ The bar does not take keyboard focus. The search entry keeps the mark. The pop-down stays anchored by `place()`.
- 🔷 ⏳ The file list gets that same kind of bar later.
- 🔷 ✔️ Default is Recent.
- 🔷 ✔️ Recent shows projects that contain a viewed file, newest file view first.
- 🔷 ✔️ Projects with no viewed file under them are left out.
- 🔷 ✔️ If none have a viewed file, Recent says `No recent projects`.
- 🔷 ✔️ All lists every project by name, A to Z, ignoring case.
- 🔷 ✔️ Search still applies on top of whichever choice is showing.
- ℹ️ Project rows in `filebase` do not use `last_viewed`. Those values stay 0.
- ℹ️ `load_projects_from_db` sets the loaded folder from `MAX(last_viewed)` of files under that path. It does not write the project row.

---

## File list

`FileSelector` already has Tree, History, and a search page. These notes are still open.

- 🔷 ⏳ The file tab is Recent. The old title History is dropped.
- ℹ️ Chat history on the phone pull-over keeps the title Chat history. That list is sessions, not files.
- 🔷 ⏳ A type filter, document versus code, is an idea for this list.
  - ℹ️ Daemon `File.is_documentation()` is markdown or plain text. Other languages are code.
  - ℹ️ Not part of the project-list work.
- 🔷 ⏳ Search filters Recent and the tree together.
- 🔷 ⏳ The client holds the whole project tree and filters it there.
- ℹ️ Today file search is server-side. `FileDropdown` debounces and `ProjectFiles.cached_search` on the daemon returns a flat page.
- 🔷 ⏳ A matching file keeps its parent folders in the tree.
- ℹ️ RooTerm does that in `app.RooTerm/src/Host/Tree.vala`.
  - A name match is kept.
  - Each parent of that match is kept, up to the root.
  - Children of a matching folder stay visible.
  - Those parents are expanded so the match is on screen.
- 🔷 ⏳ Collapse-all shortcut on the file dialog.
- 🔷 ⏳ Refresh is a last line of defence.
  - ℹ️ The server is meant to stay current.
  - ℹ️ File watch on the active project is not implemented.
  - ℹ️ Refresh covers that watch missing a change.
- 🔷 This selector reads and shows files. It does not create them.

### Questions

Current file sorting, from `ollmfilesd/ProjectFiles.cached_search`. Decide later whether the new file list uses it.

- ❓ Empty search, the browse list.
  - Files with `last_viewed` in the last 24 hours come first, newest view first.
  - The rest follow by full path.
  - `ProjectFile.is_recent` is that same 24-hour window. The row CSS is `oc-recent`.
- ❓ Typed text, no `*` or `?`.
  - Substring match on the file name or the full path, ignoring case.
  - Names that start with the text come first, then by name.
  - Names that contain the text come next.
  - Path-only matches sit with the name sort.
- ❓ Typed text with `*` or `?`.
  - Those wildcards match the file name or the full path.
  - Hits sort by full path only.
- ❓ `ProjectFiles.get_recent_list` is a different order. It uses `last_modified` over N days, newest change first. The dropdown does not use it.
- ❓ Whether this selector copies those three orders now. The file list has not been started, so this can wait.

---

## Phone and tablet

- 🔷 ⏳ Tablet uses this pull-over. It does not use the desktop pop-down.
- 🔷 ⏳ A click does not open a search field and does not raise the keyboard.
- 🔷 ⏳ A click opens a pull-over.
- 🔷 ⏳ Same pull-over for chat history, projects, and files.
- 🔷 ⏳ Top bar: back arrow, then a title.
  - Chat history
  - Projects
  - Files
- 🔷 ⏳ Current selection is text at the top of the page, under that bar.
- 🔷 ⏳ The list sits under the current selection.
- 🔷 ⏳ Search entry is at the bottom.
- 🔷 ⏳ The keyboard stays down until that bottom entry is focused.
- 🔷 ⏳ When the keyboard is up, the list collapses upward to the space left above it.
- 🔷 ⏳ Back arrow closes the pull-over.
- 🔷 ⏳ Choosing a row closes the pull-over.
- 🔷 ⏳ Which edge the pull-over comes from is not decided, and the tablet case is the open one.
- 🚫 Do not treat “left” or “right” as chosen.

### History moves onto this pull-over

- 🔷 ⏳ Phone history today keeps the window header, slides the list in, and puts search at the top.
- 🔷 ⏳ That layout changes to this pull-over.
- 🔷 ⏳ Search moves from the top to the bottom.
- 🔷 ⏳ Opening history must not focus the search entry and must not raise the keyboard.
- ℹ️ Today `history_toggle_button` grabs `history_browser.search_entry` as soon as history is shown.

---

## Phase 1 — extend `oc-test-source-diff`

- 🔷 ✔️ Same idea as the diff work: an out-of-band window, not the product app.
- 🔷 ✔️ Extend `examples/oc-test-source-diff.vala`. Do not start a second app.
- 🚫 A temporary selection tool that copies the selectors out of the diff smoke app.
- ℹ️ First mock: `examples/oc-test-source-diff-selectors.vala` (`TestSelectorRow`). That widget hard-coded the pop-down and the pull-over. See **Critical** below.

### Top row

- 🔷 ✔️ Put the project and file selector row on that window.
- 🔷 ✔️ Desktop run uses the desktop pop-down.
- 🔷 ✔️ `--phone` and `--tablet` use the pull-over in this same binary.
- ℹ️ `--phone` or `--tablet` turns the selector subtest on. File pairs stay optional.
- ℹ️ The file list landed as one search page. The next step replaces that with the full file selector.

### filesd

- 🔷 ✔️ The selectors load projects and files from a running filesd.
- ℹ️ `OLLMfiles.rpc_register`, then `ProjectManager.rpc.connect` and `rpc_load_projects_from_db`.

### Android

- 🔷 ⏳ The same extended window is the Android test.
- 💩 ⏳ How that window is packaged on Android is not specified. `oc-test-source-diff` is not in the Android APK build today.
- ℹ️ Until that packaging exists, `--phone` and `--tablet` are how the pull-over is opened.

### Critical

- 🔷 ✔️ The mock hard-coded the pull-downs inside `TestSelectorRow`.
- 🚫 Do not keep that. Do not patch the hard-coded popover, the button list, or the overlay.
- 🔷 ✔️ `ProjectSelector` and `FileSelector` live under `examples/oc-test-source-diff/`, named for the dropdowns they replace. Phone and tablet share `SelectorPull`. The smoke row only hosts them.
- 🔷 ✔️ The smoke window only hosts those classes.
- 🔷 ✔️ The click, alignment, height, file selector, and history styling in **Next** are behavior of those classes.

### Next

Seen on `--selectors`, then `--phone` and `--tablet`. The hard-coded mock showed these. The new classes are what get built. They compile. They have not been looked at on screen yet.

- 🔷 ⏳ The first project click flips the button into the search entry, focuses it, and opens the list.
  - ℹ️ Caret and typing are still open: `docs/bugs/2026-10-09-selector-search-focus.md`. File search must not grow the top row.
  - 🔷 The click on the hard-coded mock did nothing. The class opens the pop-down on idle after that click, so autohide does not eat it.
- 🔷 ⏳ The project pop-down is left aligned under the button.
  - 🔷 The hard-coded one sat in the middle of the screen. The class anchors a 280-wide rect to the left edge of the button.
- 🔷 ⏳ Each project row is left aligned.
  - 🔷 Rows are a title plus a path, same classes as the history list.
- 🔷 ✔️ Pop-down height fills the space under the row and stays inside the window.
- 🔷 ✔️ Project names are alphabetical. A `Gtk.StringSorter` on the basename orders the model. Rows are not built in that order.
- 🔷 ⏳ Searching highlights the first match. That mark is not a list selection. Up and Down move it.
- 🔷 ⏳ Enter and Tab accept that mark on every tab and move to the next control. Project moves to the file entry. A file moves to the source view. The search entry was eating both keys, so the controller has to see them first. The tree tab has no rows.
- 🔷 ⏳ With no project, a spacer keeps the history button on the right. The file control takes that gap once a project is chosen.
- 🔷 ⏳ The file pop-down is inset from the left and right of the window, and tall enough to cover the source view.
  - 🔷 The outer edge was still past the window. Popover padding and shadow sit outside the content width, so that extra has to come off the width.
- 🔷 ⏳ File search uses `Folder.fetch_files` and shows the match page. The same mark and keys work there.
  - 🔷 Typing was not showing that page. The search list was hidden with `visible = false`, which also hides a stack page. The stack page is what shows and hides it. An empty entry stays on history. Text switches to search.
- 🔷 ✔️ No file pairs: `OLLMcoder.SourceView` fills the area under the selector row. Its own header is hidden. A chosen file opens there.
- 🔷 ⏳ Project pop-down width is the longest row. The current width can stay until that measurement exists.
  - ℹ️ Project pop-down stays 280 wide. File pop-down width is the window minus padding, then minus the popover chrome.
- 🔷 ⏳ Load every project. There are not many. Do not page them.
- 🔷 ⏳ The file pop-down in this subtest is the full selector.
  - 🔷 Wide pop-down, tree, history, and search results when text is typed.
  - 🔷 That is where the filesystem layout gets designed.
  - ℹ️ Tree contents stay in `CODER-4.2.1`. This tab only says the client has not loaded the folder tree.
  - ℹ️ History is the first file page, keeping rows with a last-view time.
  - ℹ️ Search is one ''Folder.fetch_files'' page of 50. It appears only after the entry has text.
- 🔷 ⏳ Phone and tablet pull-overs look like the history session list.
  - ℹ️ `libollmchatgtk/HistoryBrowser.vala` and `resources/style.css` (`.list-chat-title` and the caption classes).
  - 🔷 The hard-coded rows were buttons. The classes use those history label classes.
- 🔷 ⏳ The phone test after that styling is an Android build, not `--phone` on the desktop.
- 🚫 Do not package that Android build in this next step.

---

## Later

- 🔷 ⏳ Product `SourceView` header and the phone history pull-over come after the smoke window shows the row on desktop and on Android.

---

## Out of scope

- 🚫 Desktop chat history. This pass only moves the phone and tablet history list onto the pull-over.
- 🚫 Implementing the tree model. That stays in `CODER-4.2.1`.
- 🚫 A phone or tablet copy of the desktop tabbed file pop-down. Tabs were specified for the desktop file pop-down only.
- 🚫 Auto-opening the file pull-over after a project pick on phone or tablet. The focus flip was specified for desktop only.
- 🚫 A new standalone selection executable. Phase 1 stays on `oc-test-source-diff`.
- 🚫 Hard-coded pull-downs inside the smoke row. The selectors are their own classes.
