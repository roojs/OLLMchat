# 1.23.6 Task Execution Prompt

## Overview

Sub-plan of 1.23.2: **create the prompt** (and executor skill content) for **task execution**. The job is to define what we tell the executor model and what we ask it to produce. Executors are implemented as **skills** in `resources/skills` (each executor skill has a body that acts as the prompt/instructions). So this plan covers: **what the executor is told** (its role, that it receives query + reference files and must produce exactly one file), **what we give it** (query, reference_files), and **what we ask it to produce** (result summary + exactly one file, with a clear delimiter and filename). The output format is part of the instructions we create.

## Status

**PLAN** — Implementation not started. Expand this document with the executor prompt/skill content and output format before implementation.

## Dependencies

- Plan 1.23.2 (Three Prompt Types and Orchestration).

## Scope

- **Creating the executor prompt/skill:** Each executor is a skill file (e.g. in `resources/skills`) whose body is the prompt. We define the **instructions** (you receive a query and reference/precursor contents in a markdown precursor area; you produce exactly one file; do not output a task list) and the **output format** (how to present the result summary and the single file so the Runner can extract filename + content). The Runner injects the actual precursor information (file bodies, prior task outputs) into this area when invoking the executor (see 1.23.3: task list has references only; refinement and execution get the contents). This plan applies to the common execution contract; individual executor skills may add domain-specific instructions but must conform to this output format.

## 1. Prompt/skill content (to expand)

- **Role and task:** What we tell the executor (e.g. you are an executor; you receive a query and reference files; you produce exactly one file). That it must not output a task list — only a summary and one artifact.
- **Input:** Query (natural language) + reference files (names + content). The Runner provides these in a **markdown precursor area** (or equivalent): the actual contents of any precursor the task referenced (current file, prior task outputs, project description, etc.) are included here so the executor has full context. So execution, like refinement, receives the real precursor information — not references. The prompt describes what the model will receive (query + precursor/reference contents).
- **Output we ask for:** Result summary (short) + exactly one file. How to delimit the file (e.g. fenced code block with filename in first line or info string, or **File:** name then content). How the executor should indicate the output filename so the Runner can store and reference it.

## 2. Output format (to expand)

- **Result summary** — Heading or label, placement (before or after the artifact).
- **Single artifact** — Exact format: fenced block with filename, or dedicated section. File identity (filename) so Runner can extract it.
- **No task list** — Instruction in the prompt; what to do if the model outputs tasks anyway.

## 3. Parsing and validation (to expand)

- How the Runner extracts summary and single file (name + content) from the executor’s response. Behaviour when format is wrong or multiple blocks.

## 4. Examples (to expand)

- Example output: summary + one fenced block with `summary.md` and content. Example: summary + one code block with `Component.jsx`.

## Rule: no annotations below the divider

When this plan is expanded with the concrete executor prompt/skill content, any content below a `---` must be **exact prompt content only**. No annotations, no explanatory text, no parenthetical notes may appear below the divider. Placeholder tokens are the only exception. All annotation and placeholder meanings belong in the sections above the divider. This applies to all prompt-creation plans (1.23.3, 1.23.4, 1.23.5, 1.23.6).

## Deliverable

- The **executor prompt/skill instructions** and **output format** we use for all executors. Executor skill files in `resources/skill-prompts` or `resources/skills` (per 1.23.2: executors are skills). Runner uses this format to parse executor output.

## References

- Plan 1.23.2 §1 (task execution), §2 (task structure).
- Plan 1.23.3 (task creation): task list uses precursor references; execution receives injected contents in precursor area.
- Plan 1.23.11 (Runner implementation): Runner collects executor output using this format; injects precursor contents when calling executor.
